Interview wait times for a TSA Global Entry interview at SFO are (as of Jan 2017) about 6 months. However, if you get lucky you might be able to get an interview slot that someone else reschedules.

This script automatically checks the Global Entry interview schedule for your given airport and texts you when there's an appointment available within 30 days, allowing you to "snipe" a cancelled appointment.
